I'm a Finnish software developer mostly interested in game and web development. My go-to game engine is Godot (both GDScript and C#) but I've also experimented with Rust and Bevy. You can see some of my stuff on [Itch.io](https://leopeltola.itch.io/) and [Github](https://github.com/leopeltola). Along with games I also make websites (such as this) but I've tipped my toes in various programming domains.

I've been tinkering with games and web stuff for what feels like forever, and I've learned everything I know from people freely sharing their knowledge on the web. I hope to give back to the awesome communities that have helped me along the way.

Expect a mix of tutorials, tips, and maybe a few rants about the trials and tribulations of software development.
